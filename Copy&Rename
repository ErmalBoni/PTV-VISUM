# Script Created by Ermal Sylejmani, and ChatGPT - 04/10/2024
# Name: Copy&Rename.py
# Key Features:
# - Copies a set of files and renames them within the same directory.
# - Easily customizable: you can add as many files as you want by updating the lists.
# - Simple usage with clear instructions.
# - Utilizes built-in Python modules (`shutil` and `os`) for file operations.
# - Provides confirmation upon successful completion.

# Instructions:
# 1. **Ensure you have Python 3.x installed** on your system.
# 2. **Place the script** in the directory containing the files you wish to copy and rename.
# 3. **Update the `files` and `new_names` lists** in the script to include your specific files:
#    - Add the original file names to the `files` list.
#    - Add the corresponding new names to the `new_names` list.
#    - Make sure both lists are of the same length.
# 4. **Run the script** using a Python interpreter:
#    ```bash
#    python script_name.py
#    ```
# 5. **Check the results**:
#    - The script will create copies of the files listed in `files`, renamed as specified in `new_names`.
#    - A confirmation message will be printed upon successful completion.
# 6. **For different projects or additional files**, simply modify the `files` and `new_names` lists accordingly.

# Example:
# To add more files, update the lists as follows:
# ```python
# files = [
#     "AM_Network.ver",
#     "AM_Flow.png",
#     "AM_Matrix.csv",
#     "AM_ExtraData.dat"
# ]
#
# new_names = [
#     "PM_Network.ver",
#     "PM_Flow.png",
#     "PM_Matrix.csv",
#     "PM_ExtraData.dat"
# ]
# ```

import shutil
import os

# Original file names
files = [
    "AM_Network.ver",
    "AM_Flow.png",
    "AM_Matrix.csv"
]

# New names for the files
new_names = [
    "PM_Network.ver",
    "PM_Flow.png",
    "PM_Matrix.csv"
]

# Working directory (current directory)
working_dir = "./"

# Copying and renaming the files
for old_name, new_name in zip(files, new_names):
    shutil.copy(os.path.join(working_dir, old_name), os.path.join(working_dir, new_name))

print("Files have been successfully copied and renamed.")
